+ This exercise requires you to cast the result of an operation into a ```double```
+ Declare and initialise two ```int``` variables, ```sum``` and ```count```
+ Intialise them to 17 and 5 respectively
+ Next declare a ```double``` called ```doubleAverage``` and an ```int``` called ```intAverage```
