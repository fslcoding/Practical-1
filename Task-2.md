# Practical One, Task Two

If your having any trouble, check out the following guides:
+ [Variables](https://github.com/fslcoding/Variables)
+ [Input / Output](https://github.com/fslcoding/Variables)

## Print out your name!

We will update our program so that it takes input from the user, in this case your name, and display it in the console

**_Step One_**

+ Change the ```Console.WriteLine("FSL Coding!");``` line so that it asks the user for their name.

**_Step Two_**

+ Now you need to declare a ```string``` variable to store the user's name.
+ It is good practice to give your variables names that accurately describe what they are.
+ To read input from the user, we use ```Console.ReadLine();```
+ This takes in text from the user
+ These characters are assigned to the variable ```MyName```

**_Step Three_**

+ Now you can use ```Console.WriteLine();``` again to print out the variable, ```MyName```
+ To do this, simply type ```"Hello, " + MyName```
+ This is called ```string concatenation```
+ By using a ```+``` after ```Hello, ```, we can add the users' name to the end of it

Now you have experience with basic input and output!
