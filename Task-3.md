# Practical One, Task Three

## Comments

+ Comments are annotations or notes written by the programmer which explains the code
+ They are ignored by the computer
+ As your program gets larger, they become very necessary

To write a comment, place two forward slashes in front of your text:
```csharp
// This is a comment

This is not
```

If you want, your comments can span multiple lines
+ You need a forward slash, and then a asterick after
+ To end the comment, do the reverse
```csharp
/*
  This
  is
  a
  multi-line
  comment
*/
```

Here is an example of some comments
