# Practical One, Task Seven

## Modified Hello World Program

This is a modified version of the Hello World Program:

```csharp

Console.WriteLine ("Hello World!);

Console.WriteIine ("Hello World!");

Console,WriteLine ("Hello World!");

console.writeline ("Hello World!");

Console.WriteLine ("Hello World!")

```

+ Each of the ```Console.WriteLine();``` statements has an error. Fix the errors so the program runs successfully.
+ What were the errors?
